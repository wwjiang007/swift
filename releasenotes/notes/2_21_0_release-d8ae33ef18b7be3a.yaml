features:
  - |
    Change the behavior of the EC reconstructor to perform a
    fragment rebuild to a handoff node when a primary peer responds
    with 507 to the REPLICATE request. This changes EC to match the
    existing behavior of replication when drives fail. After a
    rebalance of EC rings (potentially removing unmounted/failed
    devices), it's most IO efficient to run in handoffs_only mode to
    avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

  - |
    O_TMPFILE support is now detected by attempting to use it
    instead of looking at the kernel version. This allows older
    kernels with backported patches to take advantage of the
    O_TMPFILE functionality.

  - |
    Add slo_manifest_hook callback to allow other middlewares to
    impose additional constraints on or make edits to SLO manifests
    before being written. For example, a middleware could enforce
    minimum segment size or insert data segments.

  - |
    Fixed an issue with multi-region EC policies that caused the EC
    reconstructor to constantly attempt cross-region rebuild
    traffic.

  - |
    Fixed an issue where S3 API v4 signatures would not be validated
    against the body of the request, allowing a replay attack if
    request headers were captured by a malicious third party.

  - Display crypto data/metadata details in swift-object-info.

  - formpost can now accept a content-encoding parameter.

  - |
    Fixed an issue where multipart uploads with the S3 API would
    sometimes report an error despite all segments being upload
    successfully.

  - |
    Multipart object segments are now actually deleted when the
    multipart object is deleted via the S3 API.

  - |
    Swift now returns a 503 (instead of a 500) when an account
    auto-create fails.

  - |
    Fixed a bug where encryption would store the incorrect key
    metadata if the object name starts with a slash.

  - |
    Fixed an issue where an object server failure during a client
    download could leave an open socket between the proxy and
    client.

  - |
    Fixed an issue where deleted EC objects didn't have their
    on-disk directories cleaned up. This would cause extra resource
    usage on the object servers.

  - |
    Fixed issue where bulk requests using xml and expect
    100-continue would return a malformed HTTP response.

  - Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
