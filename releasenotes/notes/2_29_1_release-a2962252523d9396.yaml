deprecations:
  - |
    This is the final stable branch that will support Python 2.7.

fixes:
  - |
    Fixed s3v4 signature calculation when the client sends an un-encoded
    path in the request.

  - |
    Fixed multiple issues in s3api involving Multipart Uploads with
    non-ASCII names.

  - |
    The object-updater now defers rate-limited updates to the end of its
    cycle; these deferred updates will be processed (at the limited rate)
    until the configured ``interval`` elapses. A new ``max_deferred_updates``
    option may be used to bound the deferral queue.

  - |
    Empty account and container partition directories are now cleaned up
    immediately after replication, rather than needing to wait for an
    additional replication cycle.

  - |
    The object-expirer now only cleans up empty containers. Previously, it
    would attempt to delete all processed containers, regardless of whether
    there were entries which were skipped or had errors.

  - |
    A new ``item_size_warning_threshold`` option may be used to monitor for
    values that are approaching the limit of what can be stored in memcache.
    See the memcache sample config for more information.

  - |
    Internal clients now correctly use their configured ``User-Agent`` in
    backend requests, rather than only using it for logging.

  - |
    Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
