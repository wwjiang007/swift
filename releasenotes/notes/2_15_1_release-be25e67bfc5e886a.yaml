fixes:
  - |
    Fixed a bug introduced in 2.15.0 where the object reconstructor
    would exit with a traceback if no EC policy was configured.
  - |
    Fixed deadlock when logging from a tpool thread.

    The object server runs certain IO-intensive methods outside the
    main pthread for performance. Previously, if one of those methods
    tried to log, this can cause a crash that eventually leads to an
    object server with hundreds or thousands of greenthreads, all
    deadlocked. The fix is to use a mutex that works across different
    greenlets and different pthreads.
  - |
    The object reconstructor can now rebuild an EC fragment for an
    expired object.
