  - >
    Prevent PyKMIP's kmip_protocol logger from logging at DEBUG.
    Previously, some versions of PyKMIP would include all wire
    data when the root logger was configured to log at DEBUG; this
    could expose key material in logs. Only the kmip_keymaster was
    affected.

  - >
    Fixed an issue where a failed drive could prevent the container sharder
    from making progress.

  - >
    Fixed a bug in how Swift uses eventlet that was exposed under high
    concurrency.
