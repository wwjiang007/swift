features:
  - EC Fragment Duplication - Foundational Global EC Cluster Support.
  - name_check and cname_lookup keys have been added to `/info`.
  - Add Vary headers for CORS responses.
  - Always set Swift processes to use UTC.
  - >
    Removed per-device reconstruction stats. Now that the reconstructor
    is shuffling parts before going through them, those stats no longer
    make sense.
  - domain_remap now accepts a list of domains in "storage_domain".
  - Do not follow CNAME when host is in storage_domain.
  - >
    Enable cluster-wide CORS Expose-Headers setting via
    "cors_expose_headers".
  - Cache all answers from nameservers in cname_lookup.
fixes:
  - >
    Fixed error where a container drive error resulted in double space
    usage on rest drives. When drive with container or account database
    is unmounted, the bug would create handoff replicas on all remaining
    drives, increasing the drive space used and filling the cluster.
  - >
    Fixed UnicodeDecodeError in the object reconstructor that would
    prevent objects with non-ascii names from being reconstructed and
    caused the reconstructor process to hang.
  - >
    Fixed encoding issue in ssync where a mix of ascii and non-ascii
    metadata values would cause an error.
  - Log the correct request type of a subrequest downstream of copy.
  - >
    Prevent logged traceback in object-server on client disconnect for
    chunked transfers to replicated policies.
  - >
    Fixed a race condition in updating hashes.pkl where a partition
    suffix invalidation may have been skipped.
  - Include received fragment index in reconstructor log warnings.
  - Log correct status code for conditional requests.
other:
  - Drop support for auth-server from common/manager.py and `swift-init`.
  - Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
