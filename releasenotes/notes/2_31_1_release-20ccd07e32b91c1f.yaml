    Sharding fixes

    * Shards no longer report stats to the root database when they are in
      the ``CREATED`` state.

    * Sharding metadata is no longer cleared when databases are deleted.
      This could previously cause deleted shards that still had rows to
      become stuck and never move them to the correct database.

    * Fixed a performance regression in the handling of misplaced objects.

    * Swift path and on-disk path are now included with all sharder logging.

    ``s3token`` no longer mangles request paths that include the Access Key ID.

    User metadata is now exposed via CORS when encryption is enabled,
    matching the behavior when encryption is not enabled.

  - |
    Fewer backend requests are now required when account or container
    information is missing from memcache.

  - |
    Fixed logging of IP and port in the proxy-server; in particular,
    internal clients now correctly log about the replication IP/port.

  - |
    Fixed a bug in the object replicator that would cause an under-reporting
    of failures.

    Various other minor bug fixes.
