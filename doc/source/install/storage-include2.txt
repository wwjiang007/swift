Edit the ``/etc/swift/container-server.conf`` file and complete the
following actions:

* In the ``[DEFAULT]`` section, configure the bind IP address, bind port,
  user, configuration directory, and mount point directory:

  .. code-block:: none

     [DEFAULT]
     ...
     bind_ip = MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS
     bind_port = 6201
     user = swift
     swift_dir = /etc/swift
     devices = /srv/node
     mount_check = True

  Replace ``MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_IP_ADDRESS`` with the IP address of the
  management network on the storage node.

* In the ``[pipeline:main]`` section, enable the appropriate modules:

  .. code-block:: none

     [pipeline:main]
     pipeline = healthcheck recon container-server

  .. note::

     For more information on other modules that enable additional features,
     see the `Deployment Guide <https://docs.openstack.org/swift/latest/deployment_guide.html>`__.

* In the ``[filter:recon]`` section, configure the recon (meters) cache
  directory:

  .. code-block:: none

     [filter:recon]
     use = egg:swift#recon
     ...
     recon_cache_path = /var/cache/swift
