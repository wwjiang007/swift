"""
Monkey Patch httplib.HTTPResponse to buffer reads of headers. This can improve
performance when making large numbers of small HTTP requests.  This module
also provides helper functions to make HTTP connections using
BufferedHTTPResponse.

.. warning::

    If you use this, be sure that the libraries you are using do not access
    the socket directly (xmlrpclib, I'm looking at you :/), and instead
    make all calls through httplib.
